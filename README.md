# Cypress Apollo Example

This project demonstrates how to use Cypress for e2e testing. We are using the an apollo fullstack app form [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). ðŸš€

Use the `start` tag to begin using `git checkout start`

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
client - apollo-client + react app
server - apollo-server graphql backend

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd server && yarn i && yarn start
```

and

```bash
cd client && yarn i && yarn start
```
